A depth map of an airplane is a grayscale image where darker areas represent closer points on the airplane's surface and lighter areas represent farther points, simulating the perception of depth.
A depth map of an airplane generates a visual representation where varying shades of gray convey the relative distances of different points on the airplane's surface from an observer's viewpoint.
