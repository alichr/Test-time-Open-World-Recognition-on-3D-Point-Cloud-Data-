# PointNet with CLIP Features for Multi-View Object Classification

This repository contains code for training a multi-view object classification model using PointNet with CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) features. The model combines 2D and 3D features to perform classification on 3D point cloud data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- PyTorch 1.7 or later
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional but recommended for faster training)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pointnet-clip-object-classification.git
   cd pointnet-clip-object-classification
   ```

2. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Train the PointNet-CLIP model:

   ```sh
   python main.py --batch_size 32 --num_points 1024 --nepoch 250 --outf results
   ```

   Adjust the batch size, number of points, number of epochs, and output folder as needed.

2. Evaluate the trained model:

   ```sh
   python main.py --batch_size 32 --num_points 1024 --model results/3D_model_X.pth --outf results --feature_transform
   ```

   Replace `X` with the epoch number of the trained model.

3. View results:

   Training and testing progress, as well as accuracy, will be displayed during training and saved to a `log.txt` file in the output folder.

## Acknowledgments

- This code builds upon the PointNet architecture and CLIP model.
- Realistic_Projection module is used for projecting point clouds to 2D images.
- The dataset is assumed to be organized in the specified structure under `dataset_path`.
